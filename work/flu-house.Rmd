This report contains survey data analysis for household members.

All household members.

```{r}
# select respondent's education, race, income, location + household data
data_hhm1 <- data2 %>%
  select(c(PPEDUCAT, PPETHM, PPINCIMP, ppreg9, PPSTATEN, 374:375, 407:417)) %>%

Household children.
- includes respondent's education, race, income, location
- join/merge hhm1 and hhm2 into single dataframe

```{r}
# subset children < age 18
child1 <- data_hhm1 %>%
  filter(HHM1_AGE < 18)
child2 <- data_hhm2 %>%
  filter(HHM2_AGE < 18)

# count total number of children <18 years
child1 %>%
  group_by(HHM1_AGE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  summarise(sum(n))
child2 %>%
  group_by(HHM2_AGE) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  summarise(sum(n))

# append dataframes, rename columns to be the same
nam <- c("PPEDUCAT", "PPETHM", "PPINCIMP", "ppreg9", "PPSTATEN", "age", "name", "gender",
         "Q36", "Q36_Codes", "Q37", "Q37_Codes", "Q38", "Q38_Codes",
         "Q39", "Q40", "Q41", "Q42")
names(child1) <- nam
names(child2) <- nam

children <- rbind(child1, child2)

rm(data_hhm1, data_hhm2, child1, child2)
```

Total number of children = 270 + 260 = 530

```{r}
# age histogram
with(children, hist(age))
